## This is a p5 Practice repository

Please copy paste the ExampleSketch folder and then edit if you are doing your work. It will save you a lot of time.

I am doing some of the projects here, I will add to the list once the examples are complete and I am finished editing the code and decided to publish it.

### Projects
1. Fractal Tree : A tree generated by a recursive function in javascript.

2. Experimental L-System Projects : Various L-System trees, currently I have one finished L-System tree and I am working on finishing the other ones pretty soon. (Will update this if finished.)

Thank you for your time.
